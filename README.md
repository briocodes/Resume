# Resume
This is a simple portfolio app that gives basic details about me and what I do.
# Description
The app is built in the Kotlin programming language, and all the views are designed in XML
It consists of six activities with ease of navigation. 
The first activity contains three social buttons which navigates to my profile on different social media platforms, and also an about button, which when clicked, takes the user to a second activity which contains my developer profile.
The second activity contains an options menu with which the user can be able to navigate to the remaining four activities.
The app is localized to three languages including English, French and Spanish. Contents are automatically displayed in either of these languages based on the preset language on the device
