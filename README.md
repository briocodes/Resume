## Resume
This is a simple portfolio app that gives basic details about me and what I do.
## Description
* The app is built in the Kotlin programming language, and all the views are designed in XML.
* It consists of six screens with ease of navigation (Welcome, Profile, Resume, Certifications, Portfolio, & Services).
* The Welcome screen contains three social buttons which navigates to my profile on different social media platforms, and also an about button, which when clicked, takes the user to a second activity which contains my developer profile.
* The Profile screen contains an options menu with which the user can be able to navigate to the remaining four activities.
* The app is localized to three languages including English, French and Spanish. Contents are automatically displayed in either of these languages based on the preset language on the user's device.
* Interactions within the app are smooth, with a responsive UI
