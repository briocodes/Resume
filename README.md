## Resume
This is a simple portfolio app that gives basic details about me and what I do.
## Description
* The app is built in the Kotlin programming language, and all the views are designed in XML.
* It consists of six activities with ease of navigation. 
* The first activity contains three social buttons which navigates to my profile on different social media platforms, and also an about button, which when clicked, takes the user to a second activity which contains my developer profile.
* The second activity contains an options menu with which the user can be able to navigate to the remaining four activities.
* The app is localized to three languages including English, French and Spanish. Contents are automatically displayed in either of these languages based on the preset language on the device.
## Features 
* App Localization to different languages (English, French & Spanish)
* Splashscreen on app launch
* Open external links to social media profiles from the application using Implicit Intents
## Libraries Used
SplashScreen Library: 
* This library provides the compatibility APIs for SplashScreen and helper method to enable a splashscreen on devices prior Android 12.
* The use of this library made it somewhat easier to enable the display of a beautiful splashscreen each time the app is launched.
## In-The-Works Features
* Day/Night mode implementation.
* Improved UI design
## Challenges Encountered
* Getting a good and proper design was a huge challenge. After a reasonable but unsuccessful search for good design inspirations, had to make do with some random ideas that flew in on the go. This definitely would be improved upon.
